## About

This project is an analysis in SQL to gain insights into Covid-19 cases. It contains the processes of data loading, data cleaning, data preprocessing, data analysis and data visualisation. It showcases the use of advanced skills in Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views and Converting Data Types. The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2023.

After cleaning the data, a Tableau Dashboard was created for visualizing the data in an interactive and user-friendly format.

## Case

Insurance fraud is a huge problem in the industry and it's difficult to identify fraudulent claims. My goal was to help an insurer understand what the main characteristics of fraudulent claims are and visualize the findings. Furthermore, the insurer wanted to know if there was a correlation with the months as customer. This resulted in following questions for me:

Which state has the highest total of fraudulent claims?

What are common properties of insured who committed fraud?

What is the most common choice of incident for fraudulent claims?

Is there a correlation between the month as customer and if a claim is fraudulent?

By answering these questions, I will be able to help the insurer gain insights into fraudulent claims and what their statistical properties are.

## Data

The data contains records on fraudulent and non-fraudulent car insurance claims from the 1st of January 2015 till the 28th of February 2015. The CSV file columns are separated into various information regarding the policy, the insured, the incident, the resulting claims made and if the claim was fraudulent.
