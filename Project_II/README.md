This project encompasses a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 cases utilizing SQL, aiming to uncover valuable insights. The analysis pipeline encompasses essential stages such as data loading, data cleaning, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. By leveraging advanced SQL skills, including Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types, this project showcases a sophisticated approach to deriving meaningful conclusions. The dataset comprises detailed records of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccine administration by country, covering the period from 2020 to 2023.

Moreover, to facilitate effective communication of the findings, a visually appealing and interactive Tableau Dashboard has been developed. This dashboard provides an intuitive and user-friendly platform for exploring and interpreting the analyzed data, enhancing the accessibility and usability of the insights gained from the SQL analysis.

## Case

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on societies worldwide, prompting the need for rigorous data analysis to guide decision-making processes. The OWID COVID-19 dataset offers a comprehensive collection of daily updates on cases, deaths, vaccinations, testing, and other relevant variables for countries across the globe. This case study aims to explore this rich dataset and uncover valuable insights that can help shape public health strategies, policies, and interventions. Through this data exploration, we anticipate uncovering several interesting insights, such as:

- Identification of countries with successful containment strategies and their key contributing factors.
- Examination of the relationship between vaccination rates and infection rates, including the impact of different vaccine types.
- Evaluation of the effectiveness of testing strategies in controlling the spread of the virus.
- Analysis of the disparities in COVID-19 outcomes based on socioeconomic factors and healthcare infrastructure.
- Identification of potential indicators that can predict the severity of outbreaks in different regions.

By examining various dimensions of the data, we will gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the spread and control of COVID-19. The findings from this study can help inform public health policies, interventions, and decision-making processes, ultimately contributing to effective pandemic management strategies globally.
