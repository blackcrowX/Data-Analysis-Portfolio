## About

As a highly motivated and detail-oriented data analyst with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Administration, I have gained experience in utilizing programming languages such as SQL and Python to gather and analyse large datasets. 

My passion for data analysis has driven me to develop a strong skill set in data preparation, data modelling, data visualization, and statistical analysis. I am committed to delivering results and insights that will help businesses make informed decisions.

## Projects
These are my data analytics projects briefly describing the project, the process and technology stack used to accomplish the projects goal.

### Car Insurance Claims
