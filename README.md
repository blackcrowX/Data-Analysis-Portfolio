### Covid 19 Data Exploration
**Code:** [`SQL - COVID 19 Data Exploration.sql`](https://github.com/)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server



### Pokémon Stats Analysis

**Goal:** To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether a Pokémon is classified as legendary.

**Code:** [`Pokémon Stats Analysis (Study Project)`](https://github.com/blackcrowX/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Pok%C3%A9mon%20Stats.ipynb)
          [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github.com/blackcrowX/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Pok%C3%A9mon%20Stats.ipynb)

**Description:** This dataset includes 721 Pokemon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. It has been of great use when teaching statistics to kids.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Tidyverse 



### Legendary Pokémon Analysis

**Goal:** To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether a Pokémon is classified as legendary.

**Code:** [`Legendary Pokémon Analysis (Study Project)`](https://github.com/blackcrowX/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Legendary%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Analysis.ipynb)
