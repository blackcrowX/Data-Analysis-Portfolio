## About

As a highly motivated and detail-oriented data analyst with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, I have gained experience in utilizing programming languages such as SQL and Python to gather and analyse large datasets. My passion for data analysis has driven me to develop a strong skill set in data preparation, data modelling, data visualization, and statistical analysis. I am committed to delivering results and insights that will help businesses make informed decisions.

## Projects
These are my data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack and skills used to accomplish the projects goal.

### Car Insurance Claim Fraud

**Description:** This project is an analysis in Microsoft Excel to gain insights into car insurance claim fraud. It contains the processes of data preparation, data modelling, data validation, data visualisation and data analysis. The dataset contains records on car insurance claim fraud in 2015. The goal of the project was to understand the properties of fraudulent claims.

**Code:** [`Insurance-Claims.xlsx`](https://github.com/blackcrowX/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Project-I/Insurance-Claims.xlsx)

**Data:** [`insurance-claims.csv`](https://github.com/blackcrowX/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Project-I/insurance-claims.csv)

**Technology:** Microsoft Excel

**Skills:** PowerQuery, PowerPivot, PivotTable, PivotChart and Regression-Analysis

### Covid 19

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Code:** [`Covid-19.sql`](https://github.com/blackcrowX/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Covid-2019.sql)

**Technology:** SQL 

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

### Pokémon Stats

**Description:** This dataset includes 721 Pokemon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. It has been of great use when teaching statistics to kids. To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether a Pokémon is classified as legendary.

**Technology:** Python

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

### Legendary Pokémon

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of  Pokémon.  The records include their characteristics such as attack, defense, type and size. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing characteristics of different Pokémon. To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether a Pokémon is classified as legendary.
