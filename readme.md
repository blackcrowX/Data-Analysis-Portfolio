## About
As a highly motivated and detail-oriented data analyst with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, I have gained experience in utilizing programming languages such as SQL and Python to gather and analyse large datasets. My passion for data analysis has driven me to develop a strong skill set in data modelling, data visualization, and statistical analysis. I am committed to delivering results and insights that will help businesses make informed decisions.


## Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Insurance Claims - Data Analysis

**Description:** The dataset contains records on fictional insurance claims in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.

**Code:** [`Insurance-Claims.xlsx`](https://github.com/blackcrowX/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/)

**Data:** [`insurance-claims.csv`](https://github.com/blackcrowX/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/)

**Goal:** 

**Skills:** PowerQuery, PowerPivot, PivotTables, PivotCharts, Regression-Analysis, Correlation-Analysis, and Hypothesis-Testing

**Technology:** Microsoft Excel

### Covid 19 - Data Exploration

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Code:** [`Covid-19.sql`](https://github.com/blackcrowX/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Covid-2019.sql)

**Goal:**

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server


### Pokémon Stats - Analysis

**Description:** This dataset includes 721 Pokemon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. It has been of great use when teaching statistics to kids.

**Code:** [`Pokémon-Stats.ipynb`](https://github.com/blackcrowX/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Pok%C3%A9mon-Stats.ipynb)
          [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github.com/blackcrowX/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Pok%C3%A9mon-Stats.ipynb)

**Goal:** To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether a Pokémon is classified as legendary.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Tidyverse 


### Legendary Pokémon - Analysis

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of  Pokémon.  The records include their characteristics such as attack, defense, type and size. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing characteristics of different Pokémon.

**Code:** [`Legendary-Pokémon.ipynb`](https://github.com/blackcrowX/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Legendary-Pok%C3%A9mon.ipynb)
